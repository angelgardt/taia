**Trust associated with**
* dynamic of cooperation and competition
* resolution of conflicts
* facilitation of economic exchange
* revenue and profit
* organizational citizenship behavior
* organizational commitment
* job performance

**Behavioral tradition of trust**
- trust as retional-choice behavior (cooperative choices in a game)

**Psychological tradition fo trust**
- complex intrapersonal states associated with trust — expectations, intentions, affect, dispositions

**Theoretical Approaches to Trust Development**
* **Behavioral**
	* *How is trust defined?*
		* choice behavior derived from confidence and expectations
		* assumes rational choice
	* *How is trust measured?*
		* cooperative behavior in experimental games
	* *At what level does trust begin?*
		* beigns at zero with no prior info
		* initiated be cooperative acts by the other or indication of their motivational orientaion
	* *What causes the level of trust (distrust) to change over time?*
		* grows as cooperation is extended or reciprocated
		* otherwise declines
* **Psychological**
	* **Unidimensional**
		* *How is trust defined?*
			* confident expectations and/or willingness to be vulnerable
			* cognitive, affective, behavioral-intention elements — ***attitude???***
				* **cognitive subfactor**
					* beliefes and judjements about another's trustworthiness
					* risks [[Mayer et al. (1995)]]
				* **emotional (affective) subfactor**
					* anger because of betrayal in an experimental game [[Kramer, Brewer, Hanna (1996)]]
					* emotional bond between parties, especially in close relationships [[Lewis & Weigert (1985)]]
					* [[Song, Xu, Zhao (2022) Can people experience romantic love for artificial intelligence]]
				* **behavioral-intention subfactor**
					* demonstrated “willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of another party” [[Mayer et al (1995)]]
		* *How is trust measured?*
			* scale items where trust ranges from distrust to high trust
		* *At what level does trust begin?*
			* some argues trust begins at zero
			* other argues for moderate—high initial trust
			* factors influencing initial trust level may include personality, cognitive, social categorization processes, role-based behavior, trustee reputation, institution-based structures
		* *What causes the level of trust (distrust) to change over time?*
			* grows with increased evidence of trustee's qualities, relationship history, communication process and relationship type
			* declines when positive expectations are disconfirmed
	* **Two-Dimensional**
		* *How is trust defined?*
			* confident positive and negative expectations
			* measuring different facets of relationships
		* *How is trust measured?*
			* trust and distrust interrelated but different constructs
			* each ranges from low to high
		* *At what level does trust begin?*
			* both trust and distrust begin in low level (with no info about other)
		* *What causes the level of trust (distrust) to change over time?*
			* reasons to trust and distrust accumulate as interations with other
			* could lead to different comdinations of trust and distrust
	* **Transformational**
		* *How is trust defined?*
			* basis of trust (expected costs and benefits, knowledge, degree of shared values and identity)
		* *How is trust measured?*
			* scale items, trust is rated along different qualitative indicators or different stages
		* *At what level does trust begin?*
			* begins at a calaulative-based stage
			* initiated by reputation, structures provided rewards for trustworthiness and deterrented for defection
		* *What causes the level of trust (distrust) to change over time?*
			* grows with a positive relatioship history and increased knowledge and predictability
			* further when parties come to develop an emotional bond and shared values
			* declines when positive expectations are disconfirmed
