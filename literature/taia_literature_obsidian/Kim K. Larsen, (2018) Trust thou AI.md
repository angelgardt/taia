**Subject of the essay: trust between a consumer and The Thing**
Concepts of [[Transparent AIs]], [[Explainable AIs]], and [[Auditable AIs]]
	“*If you have the feeling that those 3 elements, Explainability, Transparency and Auditability seems approximately 1 element … well you are no alone (but don’t tell that to the “experts”).*”

Concept of explanation by [[EU GDRP]] (European General Data Protection Regulation) is vague

* Transparent and Explainable are usually the synonyms
* Trust also requires auditability

Trust between humans allowed us to faster collaboration

Trustworthy system typically means:
- the automation solution perform *consistently*
- is robust to many different situations that may occur and even some that may rarely occur
- has a very high degree of reliability (> 70%)
Additionally, you believe you understand the automation principles

“If there is a lack of trust or a break in trust between the human operator and the automation, it will lead to wasted investments, in-efficiencies and disappointing productivity growth. It may also lead to accidents and potential disasters (Sheridan & Parasuraman, 2005).”

“A large body of research shows us that the most important factors for establishing a trust bond between human and an automation function is; **reliability** (of automation), **consistency** (of automation), **robustness** (of automation), **dependability** (of human operator), **faith** (of human operator) and **understand-ability** (of human operator). *Much of which is fairly similar to what we require from another human being to be regarded as trustworthy*.”

[[SurveyMonkey “Artificial Intelligence & Human Desicion Making Sentiment Survey” (November 2017)]] 467 responses
* How do you feel about AI?
	* 16% negative
	* 36% neutral
	* 48% positive
	* 20% of respondents are enthusiastic about AI
	* 15% are uncomfortable or scared about AI
	* Millenials are significantly more negative towards AI
* How do you feel about AI?
	- Comparising 4 surveys from 2017  2018 and a total of 1623 respondents, 808 women and 815 men
	* Women
		* 31% negative
		* 42% neutral
		* 27% positive
	* Men
		* 21% negative
		* 33% neutral
		* 46% positive
	* Men w. children
		* 18% negative
		* 29% neutral

**Aspects of trust**
- the initial trust moment
	- where humsn engage with a product or service
	- crucial and scary
- sustainable trust
	- maintain trust between a user and a product
	- priors are available
	- big role of consistent performance
- broken trust or untristing 
	- trust is difficult to pepair
- the utility of trust
	- not all trust bonds are equally important, valuable, costly

**TRUST DECONSTRUCTION**

_**An agent’s trust (the trustor) is an expectation about a future action of another agent (the trustee). That other agent has been deemed (at least temporarily) trustworthy by the trustor. That other agent (the trustee) may also represent a given group or system.**_

[[John K. Rempel (1985) ”Trust in close relationships”]]
-   **[[Predictability]] or [[Consistency]]** – trustor’s subjective assessment of trustee’s trustworthiness.
	- Prior behavior of trustee is important for the trustor to assess the posterior expectations
	- prior experience with trustee → the confidence in the trustee 
	- Confidence should not be confused with faith which is a belief in something without having prior fact-based knowledge.
-   **[[Dependability]]** – a willingness to place oneself as trustor in a position of risk that the trustworthiness of the trustee turns out not to be warranted with whatever consequences that may bring. 
	- dependability can be seen as an outcome of consistency.
		- a high degree consistency/predictability → ↓ the fear of dependability.
-   **[[Faith]]** – is a belief that goes beyond any available evidence required to accept a given context as truth.
	- an act of accepting a context outside the boundaries of what is known (e.g., a leap of faith).
	- Do not confuse faith with confidence (although often when people claim to be confident, what they really mean is that they have faith).

[[Rao and Cameron (2018) “The Future of Artificial Intelligence Depends on Trust]]
-   **Provability** – predictability and consistency.
-   **Explainability** – justification for an AI-based decision (e.g., counterfactual constructions).
	- Note transparency and explainability may be closely related depending on how one implements explainability.
-   **Transparency** – factors influencing algorithm-based decisions should be available (or even visible) to users impacted by such decisions. E.g., for a rejected health insurance (all) factors impacting the negative decision to reject the application should be available to the applicant.
