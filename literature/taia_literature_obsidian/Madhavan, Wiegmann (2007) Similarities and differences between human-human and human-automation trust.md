* operators assessment of [[Predictability]] of the latter may affect their tendency to **agree with it**

[[Sheridan (2002)]]
* distinction between the different meanings of the term in HAI (human automation interaction)
	* trust as an **effect** or outcome of certain automation characteristics
	* trust as a **cause** of operator's behaviour when utilizing automation
* ‘human operator trust in automation is now a major topic of interest because it significantly affects whether and how automation is used’ (p77)

[[Lee & See (2004)]]
* three general bases of trust in the context of HAI
	* **[[Performance]]**
		* current and past operation of automation
			* [[Reliability]]
			* [[Predictability]]
			* [[Ability]]
	* **[[Process]]**
		* degree to which the algorithms are appropriate for a situation and how automation operates
	* **[[Purpose]]**
		* extent to which automation functions correspond to he designer's intent
		* describes why the automation is designed

In relation to the above operator responses to automation reliability, Luhmann (1979, 1988, see also Lewis and Wiegert 1985) introduces the notion of system trust that refers to an operator’s belief that a system is operating in a predictable manner and in keeping with expectations.

[[Credibility]] concept
